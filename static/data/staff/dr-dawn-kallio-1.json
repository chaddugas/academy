  "bio": "Dawn was raised in a military family so she spent most of her early life moving from place to place. She finished high school and college in Colorado, and is now happy to call it home again. She received her medical degree from the University of Colorado School of Medicine in 2005. She then completed her residency training in 2008 at the Barbara Bush Children's Hospital at Maine Medical Center. She is pictured here with her husband Steve and her children Bryce, Tyler and Sydney. She moved to Highlands Ranch in September 2008 and started working with Academy Park Pediatrics in October.\n\n> I would like to be a consultant for parents to help them guide their children through life so that they can reach their fullest potential. I also see myself as a strong advocate for children.\n\nDawn is a board certified pediatrician, an active fellow of the American Academy of Pediatrics and an active member of the Arapahoe County and Colorado Medical Societies.",
