  "bio": "Kristy grew up in a military family and moved around a lot, attending three different high schools! She went to college at Truman State University in Kirksville, MO and medical school at the University of Rochester in Rochester, NY. She completed her pediatric residency and chief residency in Rochester also. Kristy moved to the Denver area in 2010 to be close to her parents and sisters. She and her family (husband Dermot and sons Patrick and Conor) enjoy exploring all the fun activities Colorado has to offer. They also frequently travel to Ireland to visit Dermotâ€™s family.\n\nKristy is a board certified pediatrician and an active fellow of the American Academy of Pediatrics.\n\n> I have such an amazing job! It is such a privilege to care for children and help families navigate the joys and challenges of raising their kids.",
